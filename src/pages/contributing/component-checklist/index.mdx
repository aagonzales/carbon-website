## Definition of done

By aligning on the requirements for what it means for a component to be stable, we can create a backlog of work to be prioritized, better differentiate when an asset is a component vs pattern, share expectations with contributors, and begin to think about how we want to display the status of assets to users. We can also work backwards from this strict list of requirements to determine when an asset is in  experimental.

Note: Although not all published assets currently meet these requirements, moving forward, we’d like all new assets to adhere to them.

| Status | PDLC Phase | Description | 
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Design only | Discovery | |
| Experimental | Delivery | |
| Stable | Launch and scale | | 

## Design spec

The design specification (spec) is completed in the delivery phase of the product development lifecycle (PDLC). It is the blueprint used by developers to build the component in code and for designers making the component in Figma. It is referenced as the source of truth for the visuals and functionality of a component. Having an accurate and detailed design spec ensures the component will be built and represented consistently across experiences. 

| Requirement | Details | Why this matters |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------- | 
| Color tokens | - Design spec uses only color tokens available in the system. <br /> - Design spec only contains colors that are tokenized. <br /> - Color token usage is correct according to our documentation and matches applications across the system. | Color tokens are essential to the reusability and scalability of the system; they support a11y requirements and reduce the maintenance burden. They also allow for consistent application of color across the system, and make color functionalities like theming possible. |
