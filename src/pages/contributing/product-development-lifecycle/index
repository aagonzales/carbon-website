## Overview
IBM teams follow a process framework called the Product Development Lifecycle (PDLC). IBM defines the PDLC as the process of taking a product capability from an idea through its development and release to market, and beyond. Since product development takes place in a continuously evolving market, the framework creates room for validation in every phase of the lifecycle.

The PDLC is organized into three phases: discovery, delivery, and launch & scale. Once a product is in market, agile product teams do all these types of work concurrently, in parallel work streams, with feedback from in-market learnings shaping the priorities of both discovery and delivery.

#### PDLC applied to contribution
Carbon has applied PDLC framework to how we expect new assets like components, features, and patterns to be contributed to Carbon. We have broken the contribution process up into the same three phases, each having their own set of success criteria.

- **Discovery phase**: The purpose of the discovery phase is to address any major value, usability, feasibility and viability risks ahead of delivering product-quality code, in order to arrive at a successful product faster and at a lower cost. 
- **Delivery phase**: The delivery phase emphasizes the disciplined execution of determining how we will realize user value and maximizing the efficiency of building it. This includes the functional and non-functional requirements, and the user experience required for customers to adopt product features within a production setting. 
- **Launch and scale**: Launch and scale of course, involves having clearly defined success criteria or learning objectives that are monitored after launch. In this phase an asset will become stable and achieve Carbon’s “definition of done.”

### Definition of done

By aligning on the requirements for what it means for an asset to be done, we can create a backlog of work to be prioritized, better differentiate when an asset is a component versus a pattern, share expectations with contributors, and display the status of assets to users. With each phase, the component should progress in its completeness. Once it has reached stable, then the asset will be considered done.

| Status              | PDLC Phase       | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Draft`             | [Discovery]()        | Partially complete, ready for validation.                                            |
| `Preview candidate` | [Discovery]()        | Partially complete, with measurable results, stakeholders, and clear business value. |
| `Preview`           | [Delivery]()         | Mostly complete, changes possible based on feedback, available to use in production. |
| `Stable`            | [Launch and scale]() | Complete across code, kit, docs, design, and ready for production use.               |

### Asset types

Defining and standardizing our terms across the ecosystem is crucial as we align against the PDLC. In the past, teams operated under very different assumptions about what a “pattern” versus “component” is. It has been difficult to move towards stability without everyone being on the same page in this respect. 

Eventually, all Carbon and Carbon for IBM Products resources (e.g. libraries, assets, design kits) will follow a schema to standardize definitions and documentation. However, for now, we’re just going to focus on defining the two most important assets in our ecosystem. Each asset type has its own definition of done that must be completed before an asset can be considered done. 

| Asset type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Component | An asset that has been designed and coded, that can be imported into a UI. See the [component checklist](m/contributing/component-checklist/) for the definition of done. | 
| Pattern | Patterns are something that can be accomplished in multiple ways utilizing a combination of component(s) with additional design considerations. Because of the many ways patterns can be implemented, it is not possible to provide code for every scenario, but some patterns do have example code. | 

## Review channels 

Before an asset can move to the next phase it needs to be reviewed to ensure all requirements and criteria are being met. Below are the best ways to get a review from core Carbon maintainers. In order to not overwhelm these review channels the community first needs to show significant interest in the discovery asset. The community is the first approval gateway before the Carbon teams engages with it.

| Review channel | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| GitHub issue | Open a [feature request or enhancement](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?template=FEATURE_REQUEST_OR_ENHANCEMENT.yaml) issue in the Carbon GitHub outlining the gap that needs to be resolved. The issue should include all supporting materials and evidence you have gathered in the discovery phase. This can include competitive research, potential solutions, or prototypes.|
| GitHub pull request | Open a pull request in the appropriate Carbon [GitHub repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system) for a final review of your completed contribution. If you are seeking feedback on a proof-of-concept then open a draft pull request instead. | 
| DSAG playback | _For IBMers only_: Present your findings at a Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) meeting. [Enroll](https://ec.yourlearning.ibm.com/w3/meeting/10453549) in the event and sign up for a time slot when you are ready.|

## Discovery 

The discovery phase is where research, exploration, and validation happen. This is when innovations to the system are proposed and reviewed.

### Discovery criteria 

For an enhancement or net new asset to warrant resourcing a discovery phase, we need to determine the requirements for an asset to be considered as an innovation. Proposals need to show that the component or pattern would be useful to many teams and unique to the system. 

#### Key considerations:

– Does it replicate anything in the system already, or is there truly a gap?
– If the proposal does replicate an existing asset, is there evidence to show that the proposed solution is better?
– Is there already an existing issue or proposal in [Github](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues) to address the gap?
– Is there evidence that the new asset or enhancement would be useful for many teams or services?
– What is the ratio of feasibility to impact to help prioritize (consult developers and accessibility SMEs)?

#### Discovery status

All assets in the discovery phase start as drafts. As the asset progresses in its completeness and validation it can graduate from `draft` to `preview candidate`. This means its ready to be reviewed and seriously considered for inclusion as a maintained asset in the system. Carbon is not the gatekeeper of the discovery phase; this phase is fully curated by the community and innovators. 

#### Evaluation and next steps

The Carbon team and partners will review the proposals and determine next steps. Only the Carbon team can move as asset from discovery to delivery in core Carbon or Carbon for IBM Products. 

Not all proposals in the discovery phase will move on in the lifecycle, some explorations may not gain traction or may be deprioritized by other efforts. This does not mean they are not valid or shouldn’t be used; it only means it currently isn’t a priority to systematize at the core level. 

It’s also important to note that Carbon does not take on ownership and maintenance of certain types of assets like full applications, third party tooling, and shared services. For example, although it is shared tooling, the Carbon team does not include the Carbon for AI chat or IBM Assist Me in its libraries. 

## Delivery 

In the delivery phase, the Carbon team usually collaborates with a workgroup or discovery team to begin to codify and implement their asset for preview in the Carbon library. 

### Delivery criteria

As a component or pattern enters the delivery phase, we begin to complete the requirements for an asset to reach "stable.” By aligning across the Carbon ecosystem on our requirements for stability—or a definition of done— we not only share our expectations with contributors, but we can more easily create a backlog of work to prioritize, and more clearly display the status of assets to users.

#### Milestones:

– Carbon team will collaborate with the subject matter experts and establish a feasible quarterly roadmap (3-in-a-box perspective)– A strong source of truth has been established in Figma, including robust design specs and initial usage docs– Identify 5–8 stakeholder teams for early usage and feedback
– Backlog work begins on kit, docs, code triumvirate per definition of done
– Any breaking changes are integrated into the Carbon library behind a [feature flag](/components/overview/feature-flags/)

#### Prioritization

Once a contribution enters the delivery phase it must be prioritized against the other contributions and work streams. The most important factor in determining prioritization in the contribution pipeline is business impact. The greater the case for reuse or support for a high impact team, the more likely a proposal is to move up in the pipeline and garner more Carbon resources.

#### Delivery status

All assets in the delivery phase are considered in `preview`. Carbon formerly called this status “experimental” but we wanted to increase the confidence and requirements of this status to be available for use in production. However, it is not stable yet and breaking changes are still possible based on feedback from use in products. 

## Launch and scale 

Launch and scale of course, involves having clearly defined success criteria or learning objectives that are monitored after launch. In this phase an asset will become stable and achieve Carbon’s “definition of done” as defined below.

### Launch and scale criteria

In the delivery phase, the workgroups should begin to think about the requirements for a component or pattern to become “stable.” In the launch and scale phase, all of those requirements must be met. 

#### Full, peer-review completed requirements
Along the way you should be requesting peer on the various deliverables. It is crucial to get reviews early and often to make sure all requirements are accounted for. Reach out to the Carbon team if you are unsure who should review your work.

#### Launch and scale status
All components in the in launch and scale phase are `stable`. This means all requirements in the assets [definition of done]() are complete and the asset is ready to use in production.

#### Final steps
— Once an asset is complete there should be a communication plan in place to raise awareness of the new work across multiple channels. — PMs should also begin to track the usage (product insertions) of the new asset via Figma’s API and the IBM Telemetry service.
